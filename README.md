# loan-status-prediction
- In this project we will be predicting the loan status, I have used support vector machine concept.
- This is the algorithm which is mostly used in supervised learning algorithms and also regression models.

## Support Vector Machine 

“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges.
