# loan-status-prediction
- In this project we will be predicting the loan status, I have used support vector machine concept.
- This is the algorithm which is mostly used in supervised learning algorithms and also regression models.

## Support Vector Machine 

“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges.

However,  it is mostly used in classification problems.

In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is a number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.

Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well
